<h1>Futsal management admin pannel.</h1>
<p>We are here to promote the football industry.</p>
<p>Futsal is played by two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper. There are no restrictions on substitutions. Unlike some other types of indoor soccer, it is played on a hard court surface with lines; no walls or boards are used. It is played with a smaller, harder, lower-bouncing ball than football.  The surface, ball, and rules all favor ball control and passing in tight quarters.  The game emphasizes control, improvisation, creativity, and technique. </p>
